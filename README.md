# Sources for jekyll-octopod.github.io

Today, on November 9th 2020, after 1690 days of maintenance, 204 commits and 59 releases, I stop working
on this project due to lack of time.

I would probably rather start a rewrite in dart than trying to fix what
I don't like about this project. Back in October 2020 I tried to collect
[my thoughts on the status](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-octopod/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
and they are mostly still valid.

I case you want to step up as maintainer of this project, get in touch! (<stefan.haslinger@informatom.com>)

These files are the sources to generate Github pages for jekyll-octopod.

As the software and the site itself, they are [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/jekyll-octopod/jekyll-octopod.github.io.source/blob/master/LICENSE).

The site is a jekyll-octopod page itself. Nifty meta, eh?
