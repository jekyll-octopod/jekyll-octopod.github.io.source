# Prerequisites

The [Ruby programming language](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and its package manager [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).

Nice installation guides for the different operating systems can be found at
the [Rails Girls Website](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install). You can stop
right before installing Rails, because we do not depend on Ruby on Rails here.

You can check if you succeeded by entering

{% highlight shell %}
$ ruby -v
$ gem -v
{% endhighlight %}
at the command prompt. Both commands should return version greater or equal 2.0 .
